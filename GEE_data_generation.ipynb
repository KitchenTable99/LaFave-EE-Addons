    "# Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "This program has two main functionalities. It will display satillite data overlayed over an imported shapefiile (imported from Google Earth Engine). The second–-and more unique functionality--is to download the aggregate data into a csv file (or multiple if time-series analysis is desired).\n",
    "    \n",
    "As the user, you can change a few of the parameters to obtain the data that you want.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Shapefile\n",
    "\n",
    "The shapefile that this program draws from can be any shapefile or certain csv files. The process for selecting your desired shapefile is simple. There are two ways to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Google Earth Engine Asset\n",
    "1. Upload shapefile to Google Earth Engine under the Assets tab\n",
    "2. Obtain the path to the shapefile. If you click on the asset, this is the TableID.\n",
    "3. In the User Variables section, assign the variable `FEATURE_COLLECTION_PATH` to the path <br><br>\n",
    "**THE PATH MUST BE SURROUNDED BY QUOTES**<br>\n",
    "good example: `FEATURE_COLLECTION_PATH = 'users/ccbitt23/testDHS2'` <br>\n",
    "bad example: `FEATURE_COLLECTION_PATH = users/ccbitt23/testDSH2`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Local CSV file\n",
    "1. Make sure your csv file has exactly three columns such that the first one is the name, the second the latitude, and third the longitude.\n",
    "2. Obtain the path to the csv. If it is located in your working directory, it is simply the name of the csv. Make sure to add the .csv to the end of it.\n",
    "3. In the User Variables section, assign the variable `FEATURE_COLLECTION_PATH` to the path <br><br>\n",
    "**THE PATH MUST BE SURROUNDED BY QUOTES**<br>\n",
    "good example: `FEATURE_COLLECTION_PATH = 'indotest_latlon.csv'` <br>\n",
    "bad example: `FEATURE_COLLECTION_PATH = indotest_latlon.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Date Range\n",
    "\n",
    "While this program can be used to gather data for a single month or a single year, it's main strength is the ability to gather data for time-series analysis. Setting the beginning and end dates is also simple.\n",
    "* If you want to analyze by month:\n",
    "    1. In the User Variables section, assign the variable `START_DATE` to your desired start date as a string of MM-YYYY\n",
    "    2. In the User Variables section, assign the variable `END_DATE` to your desired end date as a string of MM-YYYY <br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "good example:<br>`START_DATE = '04-2014'` <br> `END_DATE = '08-2014`\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you want to analyze by year:\n",
    "    1. In the User Variables section, assign the variable `START_DATE` to your desired start date as a string of YYYY\n",
    "    2. In the User Variables section, assign the variable `END_DATE` to your desired end date as a string of YYYY <br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "good example:<br>`START_DATE = '2014'` <br> `END_DATE = '2017`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changing Satellite Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Changing the satellite data set is the most difficult change, but it is still not very difficult. The [Google Earth Engine Data Catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog) is a complete directory of the datasets that are compatible with Google Earth Engine.\n",
    "1. Aquire the path for the desired dataset. This is the part of the Earth Engine Snippet in quotes.\n",
    "    * In the case of `ee.ImageCollection(\"AAFC/ACI\")` the path would be `\"AAFC/ACI\"`\n",
    "2. In the User Variables section, assign the variable `SATELLITE_PATH` to the path identified in Step 1.\n",
    "3. Determine the band that you want the program to use for data analysis.\n",
    "4. In the User Variables section, assign the variable `BAND_SELECT` to the desired band **making sure to keep capitalization consistent.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Last Note\n",
    "\n",
    "This program is really aimed at creating aggregate statistics. If you want to find the sum of tree-loss pixels (for example), this is possible. You'll just have to delve into what I've written outside of the easy-to-use user variables."
